# Setup

Normally ODM360 is installed using the Debian packages (see the Readme in the [debian directory](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/odm360/tree/main/debian) for more details).

This directory contains documentation and working scripts for the manual install process, some of which provides the source material for the .deb package-based install.
