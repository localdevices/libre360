# Intended to be run as a service from systemd.
# gnss.service file included in code repo.

# Checks for the presense of serial devices /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyACM0.
# If it finds them, launches str2str utility from RTKLIB to create .ubx log.
# Checks if that log is growing. If not, retries forever.

# Make it easier to write to the log with date/time prepended.
# Expecting user to ssh into the Pi and use tail -f log.txt.
